# EU Policy Feedback

## Data Collection 1989 – Today
- [x] CEPS EurLex (1952 – 2019)
- [ ] Moodley (1971 – 2022)
- [ ] Collect summaries? Example: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904&qid=1719922563047

## Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS)
- LSS is a method to measure the semantic similarity of terms to a set of seed words
- Manual: https://koheiw.github.io/LSX/articles/pkgdown/basic.html

### To do 
- [x] Compare outcome between use of sentences and use of paragraphs ([link to script](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/25eb77853a3c13fc64313bf19f83ab684a378693/lss/01_run_lss.R#L23)) → No discernible difference in outcome
- [x] What is the subject matter "marketing"?
- [x] Perform LSS "background" checks, i.e., synonyms for seed words
- [ ] Create different set of seed words, find a way to document differences
- [ ] Continue in 01_run_lss, line 126
- [ ] Adjust GloVe embedding size from 50 to 300

## Embeddings
- Compare policies with existing data
	- EP speeches and party manifestos
	- Policies or laws from another jurisdiction (e.g., UK), where policy author/creater and their political affiliation are known
- Create an embedding for each EP faction and topic (e.g., left-wing and climate issues). Then label each policy with a topic. Then calculate embeddings for each policy and assign the policy to the closest faction based on the issue.

## Ranking
- Get an LLM to compare two policies with each other: Which policy is more left or more right?
- Try out with the entire policy and also with a summary of the policy
- Based on this, create a ranking of all policies
- BradleyTerry algorithm

## Recreate existing measurement techniques
…

## Evaluation
- [ ] Create tags / topics of each document to see if there's a correlation between topics and calculated ideology
- [ ] Compare with existing measurments
- [ ] Compare results with each other
