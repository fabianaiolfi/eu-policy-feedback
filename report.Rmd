### Research Question
How left or right are EU policies?


### Data
I use the [CEPS EurLex dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0EGYWY), which contains around 70k directives and regulations dated between 1989 and 2019. To keep the examination efficient, I work with a random selection of 10k directives and regulations.

```{r child = 'lss/lss_report.Rmd'}
```
