# Evaluation Report

This report explains how the political ideology of EU directives and regulations was calculated and assessed. It compares the results to a ground truth dataset.

Three methods were evaluated: the approach by [simonhixPoliticalIdeologyPolicyLoss2024], a natural language processing (NLP) approach using latent semantic scaling (LSS) and finally an approach applying large language models (LLMs). The ground truth is based on [nanouEvercloserUnionMeasuring2017].

The comparison shows that the [simonhixPoliticalIdeologyPolicyLoss2024] method aligns closest with the ground truth than the other methods.

## Data: Preambles and summaries of directives and regulations between 1989 and 2024

Two sources of natural language data were used in the analysis:

1. Preambles: The preamble text of policies was used, as suggested by Hix and Hoyland [simonhixPoliticalIdeologyPolicyLoss2024]. Text was cut off at "Adopted this directive/regulation" (p. 12). Preambles were collected from the [CEPS EurLex dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0EGYWY) [borrettCEPSEurLexDataset2020], covering about 70k directives and regulations from 1989 to 2019. Additional policies from 2019 to August 2024 were collected using the [eurlex](https://michalovadek.github.io/eurlex/) R package [ovadekFacilitatingAccessData2021], resulting in 74,734 policies total.

2. Summaries: EUR-Lex provides summaries for some policies ([example](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904&qid=1719922563047)). Summaries are provided by EUR-Lex on a [case-by-case basis](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/summaries.html). A total of 1,637 summaries were scraped from eur-lex.europa.eu using [this script](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/data_collection/eurlex_summaries.R).

## Methods

### Existing Methods
[simonhixPoliticalIdeologyPolicyLoss2024, p. 12] classify 100-word text segments as left, right, or neutral using these methods:

1. RoBERT Left Right
A [RoBERT classifier](https://huggingface.co/niksmer/RoBERTa-RILE) trained on a corpus of party manifestos.

2. Bakker Hobolt Econ and Bakker Hobolt Social
A fine-tuned [ManiBERT classifier](https://huggingface.co/niksmer/ManiBERT) that identifies Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) policy-issue codes. Results are classified as “left” or “right” based on the modified CMP measures in [bakkerMeasuringPartyPositions2013, Table 2.4., p. 38].

3. CMP Left Right
A fine-tuned [ManiBERT classifier](https://huggingface.co/niksmer/ManiBERT) that identifies Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) policy-issue codes. Results are classified as “left” or “right” using [bakkerMeasuringPartyPositions2013, Table 2.2., p. 33] CMP left-right dimension terms.

Each 100-word segment receives “left,” “right,” or “neutral” tags. To convert these occurrences into a score, the authors use the “logit-scaled left-right position” method from [loweScalingPolicyPreferences2011].

### Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS)
LSS is a method for measuring the semantic similarity between documents and a set of seed words. In this analysis, each directive or regulation is a document and the seed words convey “typical” left-right terms. The semantic similarity between documents and seed words is calculated using word embeddings provided by [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). To keep computation efficient, I use the smallest pre-trained word vectors model available (6B tokens, 400K vocab, 50 dimensions). The economic seed words can be viewed [here](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/lss/seed_words_econ_manual.yml), the social seed words [here](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/lss/seed_words_social_manual.yml).

### LLM Methods
The LLMs methods use the following models:
- [OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/), accessed via the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
- Meta’s [Llama 3.2 1B](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2:1b), used locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
- [DeepSeek V3](https://www.deepseek.com/)

Two different methods were applied: 0-shot and ranking.

#### 0-Shot
This method asks the LLM to score a policy on an economic left-right scale of 0 to 100 based on set criteria.

The following prompt was sent:

```
You are an expert in European Union policies. Answer questions and provide information based on that expertise.

[I’m going to show you a summary of an EU policy | I’m going to show you the beginning of a preamble of an EU policy.] Please score the policy on a scale of 0 to 100. 0 represents economic left-wing policies, such as government intervention in the economy, redistribution of wealth, social welfare programs, progressive taxation, regulation of markets, and support for labor rights. 100 represents economic right-wing policies such as free market capitalism, deregulation, lower taxes, privatization, reduced government spending, and individual financial responsibility. Please *only* return the score and absolutely nothing else. Here’s the [summary | preamble]:

…
```

In addition, I queried DeepSeek on a social left-right scale:

```
You are an expert in European Union policies. Answer questions and provide information based on that expertise.

I’m going to show you a summary of an EU policy. Please score the policy on a scale of 0 to 100. 0 represents socially progressive policies, such as support for LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, racial justice, reproductive rights, inclusive social policies, expansive immigration policies, criminal justice reform, environmental justice, and secularism in governance. 100 represents socially conservative policies, such as emphasis on traditional family values, opposition to same-sex marriage, restrictions on reproductive rights, stricter immigration controls, prioritization of national identity, opposition to multiculturalism, support for tough-on-crime policies, environmental skepticism, and the promotion of religion in public life. Please only return the score. Here’s the summary:

…
```

#### Ranking
This method compares two policies. Two random policies are presented to the LLM, which decides which policy is more economically left (or right) based on set criteria. The “winning” policy is flagged. Repeating this process many times and recording “winning” and “losing” policies enables the use of the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to calculate a score for each policy. Economically left “winning” policies receive a higher “left” score than economically left “losing” policies.

## Evaluation: Comparison with Nanou 2017 Dataset
I compare the calculated policy scores with a dataset provided by Nanou 2017 [nanouEvercloserUnionMeasuring2017], which I treat as the ground truth. Nanou 2017 provides policy scores for 5-year periods across nine broad policy areas:

1. Economic and Financial Affairs
2. Competitiveness
3. Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs
4. Environment
5. Agriculture and Fisheries
6. Transport, Telecommunications, Energy
7. Education, Youth and Culture
8. Justice and Home Affairs
9. Foreign and Security Policy

To make the calculated scores comparable with Nanou 2017 [nanouEvercloserUnionMeasuring2017], I:
- Normalise all results using z-score.
- Assign each directive and regulation to a broad policy area based on a policy’s [subject matter](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/content/e-learning/browsing_options.html).
- Calculate the average for each time period and policy area.

Mapping between broad policy area and subject matter is performed with [this script](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/evaluation/policy_area_moodley_subj_matter_mpolicy.R).

## Results
I evaluate the summaries and the preambles separately using the following metrics:

- Pearson Correlation: A higher correlation between a calculated score and the ground truth suggests that the averaged calculated scores are closer to the ground truth.

- Correlation Scatter Plots: Each point in these plots represents an averaged score for a broad policy area in a specific time period. The x-axis shows the calculated scores (described in the plot’s title), and the y-axis shows the ground truth. The diagonal gray line represents perfect correlation, while the blue line represents the trend line for the calculated scores. Closer convergence of the blue and gray lines indicates better alignment with the ground truth.

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between calculated scores and the ground truth. Smaller MAE values indicate that the calculated scores are closer to the ground truth.

- Adjusted MAE With Variance Penalties: The ground truth exhibits much higher variance than the calculated scores. To address this, I introduce a variance penalty that penalizes scores for their lack of variance. The MAE is adjusted by multiplying it by the inverse of the variance ratio, which is the ratio of the variance of the ground truth to the variance of the calculated scores. Scores with higher variance are less penalized, while scores with lower variance are more penalized.
