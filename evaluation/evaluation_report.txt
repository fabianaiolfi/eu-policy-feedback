# Evaluation Report

## Data: Preambles and summaries of directives and regulations between 1989 and 2024

- Two sources of natural language data were used in the analysis.
- The first source is a policy’s preamble. This is suggested by Hix Hoyland [SOURCE], who use the preamble text but cut it off when “Adopted this directive/regulation” appears (p. 12). 
- The preambles were collected using the [CEPS EurLex dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0EGYWY), which contains around 70k directives and regulations from 1989 to 2019. Policies post-2019 up to August 2024 were collected using the [eurlex](https://michalovadek.github.io/eurlex/) R package. This leads to a total of 74,734 policies.
- The second source is a policy’s summary. EUR-Lex provides a summary for some directives and regulations (see [this example](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904&qid=1719922563047)). Summaries are provided on a case-by-case basis, as described [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/summaries.html). 1637 summaries were scraped from [eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html) using [this script](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/data_collection/eurlex_summaries.R).

## Methods
- Existing methods were implemented and then compared with two novel methods using large language models (LLMs).


### Existing Methods
- Hix Hoyland [SOURCE, p. 12] classify 100-word text segments into left, right and neutral. They then use a method described by Lowe et al (2011) [SOURCE] to turn the number of occurences into a score.

1. RoBERT Left Right
- [RoBERT classifier](https://huggingface.co/niksmer/RoBERTa-RILE) trained on the corpus of party manifestos

2. Bakker Hobolt Econ and Social
- Uses a fine-tuned [ManiBERT classifier](https://huggingface.co/niksmer/ManiBERT) to identify the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) policy-issue codes
- Then combined with Bakker-Hobolt’s modified CMP measures (Table 2.4., p. 38) [SOURCE] 

3. CMP Left Right
- Uses a fine-tuned [ManiBERT classifier](https://huggingface.co/niksmer/ManiBERT) to identify the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) policy-issue codes
- Then combined with CMP left-right dimension (Table 2.2., p. 33) [SOURCE]

- Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS)
LSS is a method for measuring the semantic similarity between documents and a set of seed words. In our case, each directive or regulation is a document and the seed words convey “typical” left-right terms. The semantic similarity between documents and seed words is calculated using word embeddings provided by [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). To keep computation efficient, I use the smallest pre-trained word vectors model available (6B tokens, 400K vocab, 50 dimensions).
- [Economic seed words](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/lss/seed_words_econ_manual.yml)
- [Social seed words](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/lss/seed_words_social_manual.yml)

### LLM Methods
- The LLMs methods use two models: OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4o mini, using the OpenAI API, and Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, using Ollama locally

0-Shot
- This method asks the LLM to score a policy on a economic left-right scale of 0 to 100 based on set criteria.

Prompt
```
You are an expert in European Union policies. Answer questions and provide information based on that expertise.

[I’m going to show you a summary of an EU policy | I’m going to show you the beginning of a preamble of an EU policy.] Please score the policy on a scale of 0 to 100. 0 represents economic left-wing policies, such as government intervention in the economy, redistribution of wealth, social welfare programs, progressive taxation, regulation of markets, and support for labor rights. 100 represents economic right-wing policies such as free market capitalism, deregulation, lower taxes, privatization, reduced government spending, and individual financial responsibility. Please *only* return the score and absolutely nothing else. Here’s the [summary | preamble]:
```

Ranking
- This method pits two policies against each other. Two random policies are picked and shown to the LLM. The LLM then has to decide which policy is more economically left (or right), depending on a set of criteria. The “winning” policy is then flagged. Repeating this method enough times, i.e., recording many “winning” and “losing” policies, allows to implement the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) in order to calcualte a score for each policy. Economically left “winning” policies receive a higher “left” score than policies that are economically left “losing”.

## Evaluation
- Comparison with Nanou 2017
	- 1989 to 2014

- I compare the calcualted policy scores with a dataset provided by Nanou 2017 [SOURCE], which is the closest to a ground truth that’s possible in this context.
- Nanou 2017 provide policy scores for 5-year periods for nine broad policy areas
- In order to make the calculated scores comparable with Nanou 2017 [SOURCE], I normalise all results using z-score, assign each directive and regulation to a broad policy area based on [these criteria](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/eu-policy-feedback/blob/main/evaluation/policy_area_moodley_subj_matter_mpolicy.R), and calcualte the average for each time period and policy area.
