0-shot llama output on scoring policy on a left-right scale between 0 and 100. Only looks at policies with summaries (n=1637). Each policy is repeated 5 times in order to calculate an average. This is done under the assumption that the LLM will provide different scores for the same policy, thus prompting the LLM several times for the same policy lets us calcualte an average score.
